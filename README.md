# Threat Intelligence Investigation

## Overview
This project documents a threat intelligence investigation to analyze a suspicious domain and identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

This investigation is conducted for educational purposes using publicly available
threat intelligence tools. No interaction with malicious infrastructure was performed.

### VirusTotal Analysis

Indicator: example.com  
Analysis Date: March 2026  

Key Findings:
- Security vendor detections: 0/90
- Domain reputation: No malicious detections
- First seen: Historical domain used for documentation and testing

Assessment:
The domain example.com does not show any malicious indicators on VirusTotal. 
No security vendors currently flag the domain as suspicious or malicious.
### WHOIS Analysis

Registrar: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)  
Domain Creation Date: 1995  

Key Findings:
- Domain is maintained by IANA
- Reserved for documentation and testing purposes
- Not associated with commercial or malicious activity

Assessment:
WHOIS records confirm that example.com is an officially reserved domain used in 
documentation and technical examples. The domain is considered safe.

### DNS Analysis

A Record:
- 104.18.26.120

Name Servers:
- a.iana-servers.net
- b.iana-servers.net

Key Findings:
- DNS records correspond to infrastructure operated by IANA
- No suspicious subdomains identified

Assessment:
DNS infrastructure appears legitimate and consistent with a reserved test domain.
## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Indicator | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| example.com | Domain | Reserved domain used for testing |
| 104.18.26.120 | IP Address | Associated infrastructure |
## Analyst Assessment

The investigation of example.com across multiple threat intelligence sources
did not reveal any malicious indicators. VirusTotal shows no vendor detections,
and WHOIS records confirm the domain is operated by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) for documentation purposes.

Based on the available intelligence, the domain does not present a security risk.
This investigation demonstrates the process of validating indicators using
multiple threat intelligence sources before drawing conclusions.
